# rabbitmq-client-examples
For the purpose of learning, I created this repo of RabbitMQ code examples, which basically follows the tutorial given by the official site.  

Along with this repo, I have also published a post: *[Basic Concepts About RabbitMQ](https://zhongyangma.github.io/archivers/Basic-Concepts-About-RabbitMQ)*, where I recorded down some important aspects of message queue and several relating stuffs. Welcome to visit and leave your valuable comments.
